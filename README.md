# Blocktales

Decentralised storytelling utilising blockchain technology. Available at blocktal.es

## How it Works

*blocktales* allows users to write stories together on a completely decentralised platform. 

When a user submits a suggestion for the next word in a story, they begin mining for their word on the *blocktales* blockchain (subject to verification through natural language processing, grammar checking and blacklisting). Users compete with their computing power and mining capacity to have their words added to the ledger (the story). The first user to successfully mine their word is able to add their word to the story and the cycle begins again with a new ledger.

## Features

### Blockchain

To solve the unique challenges we faced, we developed our own decentralised blockchain system utilising a peer to peer JavaScript library. 

### Decentralisation

The *blocktales* system is designed to be fully decentralised. Users can choose to compete against existing solutions or cooperate by contributing their computing power towards mining existing suggestions.

### Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing is used to verify whether words are correct, both on the client side and within the blockchain verification system. This protects stories against inconsistent grammar and offensive language.
